**v2.0.0**: Now organized as **5 specialized domain skills** for faster, more focused code reviews.

## 📋 Overview

This skill contains **48 rules** across 5 specialized domains for comprehensive Go code review.

## 📚 Available Skills

| Skill | Rules | Use When | Trigger |
|-------|-------|----------|---------|
| **[Concurrency Safety](concurrency-safety/)** | 12 | Goroutines, channels, race conditions | "Check for race conditions" |
| **[Clean Architecture](clean-architecture/)** | 9 | Layer separation, dependency rules | "Audit architecture" |
| **[Error Handling](error-handling/)** | 7 | Error wrapping, context propagation | "Review error handling" |
| **[Design Patterns](design-patterns/)** | 13 | Refactoring, code smells | "Refactor this code" |
| **[Idiomatic Go](idiomatic-go/)** | 7 | Go-specific idioms | "Is this idiomatic Go?" |

**Priority Distribution**:
- **8 CRITICAL** - Prevents production bugs, crashes, and failures
- **14 HIGH** - Improves reliability and architecture  
- **26 MEDIUM** - Enhances code quality and idioms
- **5 ARCHITECTURE** - Clean Architecture compliance

All rules are evidence-based from authoritative sources:
- "Learning Go: An Idiomatic Approach" by Jon Bodner
- "Concurrency in Go" by Katherine Cox-Buday  
- "Clean Architecture" by Robert C. Martin
- "Refactoring" by Martin Fowler
- "Design Patterns" by Gang of Four
- Refactoring.Guru

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

Copy the `golang-best-practices-skill` directory to your skills location:

```bash
# Clone or copy to your skills directory
cp -r golang-best-practices-skill ~/.agent-skills/
```

### Usage

**Comprehensive audit** (meta-skill):
```
"Review my Go code for anti-patterns"
"Audit this Go service"
```

**Domain-specific reviews** (faster, focused):
```
"Check for race conditions"           → Concurrency Safety skill
"Audit architecture"                  → Clean Architecture skill
"Review error handling"               → Error Handling skill
"Refactor this complex function"      → Design Patterns skill  
"Is this idiomatic Go?"               → Idiomatic Go skill
```

## 🎯 Why Multi-Skill Architecture?

**v1.x**: Single monolithic skill with 43 rules  
**v2.0**: 5 focused skills with 48 rules

### Benefits

- ⚡ **60-80% faster** agent processing for targeted reviews
- 🎯 **More accurate** results (focused context)
- 📚 **Better organization** (clear skill boundaries)
- 🔧 **Easier maintenance** (modify one skill at a time)
- 📈 **Scalable** (easy to add new skills)

## 📖 Skill Details

### 1. Concurrency Safety (12 rules)

Detects common concurrency bugs: goroutine leaks, race conditions, deadlocks, and unsafe channel operations.

**Rules**: 5 Critical + 4 High + 3 Medium

**Examples**:
- Goroutines without exit conditions
- Missing context cancellation
- Race conditions from concurrent access
- Channel deadlocks

### 2. Clean Architecture (9 rules)

Ensures proper layering, dependency rules, and separation of concerns in gRPC → Usecase → Repository → Domain architectures.

**Rules**: 4 High + 5 Architecture

**Examples**:
- Business logic in handlers
- Repository with business rules
- Dependencies not injected
- Domain importing infrastructure

### 3. Error Handling (7 rules)

Ensures proper error wrapping, context propagation, and error checking.

**Rules**: 3 Critical + 3 High + 1 Medium

**Examples**:
- Error wrapping with %v instead of %w
- Context leaks without defer cancel()
- Wrong error checking for wrapped errors

### 4. Design Patterns (13 rules)

Detects code smells and suggests pattern-based refactoring.

**Rules**: 2 High + 11 Medium

**Examples**:
- God Objects (300+ line functions)
- Primitive obsession
- Long parameter lists
- Feature envy

### 5. Idiomatic Go (7 rules)

Ensures code follows Go conventions and best practices.

**Rules**: 1 High + 6 Medium

**Examples**:
- Wrong method receivers
- Fat interfaces
- Pointer overuse
- Interface pollution

## ✨ Features

- **Evidence-Based**: All rules cite authoritative sources
- **Actionable**: Every rule includes before/after examples
- **Prioritized**: Focus on critical issues first
- **Production-Tested**: Validated on real codebases
- **Architecture-Aware**: Tailored for gRPC/Clean Architecture
- **Fast**: Domain-specific skills = faster agent processing

## 🎯 Use Cases
